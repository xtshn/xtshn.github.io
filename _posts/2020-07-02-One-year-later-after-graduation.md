A bad grade.

It's been one year since I submitted my master thesis.  

The thesis is about the back side of Wikipedia, which means I investigated specifically the **discussion page** in terms of how people back aritcles participate in the process of writing articles and how knowledge/information is generated through the mechanism of Wikipedia. I chose to analyse how a policy in Wikipedia was created. Yes, even the rules and guides are created through discuss from users. To some extent, I think it's sort of meta-analysis because articles are restricted by guidelines and policies however these rules are also created by deliberation.  

My intention was to research a topic where everyone is able to reach but rarely have closely insights or even without any clues of its existent. Unfortunately, I didn't received a good grade since the work is lack of originality according to my examinator.  

I am kinda agree because I remembered I was stuck many times when I was trying to find references to link my thoughts during the process if I didn't find appropriate sources. In other words, although my logic could make sense without proper references it wouldn't be allowed to write it down by not indicating previous researches. True though, I might rely too much on the litterature and this is the point I felt that I won't keep studying further in social science. I hope I am wrong and it's just my personal experience and thought. Beside, I also felt that qualitative research must to be unique otherwise it might not be worthy to do further investigate. However, why can't people pay attention to those literally **'normal' things/people** in our daily life? Must it have to be a social movement or very special situation? I am certainly lack of competence to spot on such things.  

Anyway, it's been past and I also recorded a audio about my post-thesis life where I talked similarly about the last term in master study.  

If I could have chosen again, I would definitely choose another area which is easier to find jobs.
