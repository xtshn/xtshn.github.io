I"Ì<p>Hej!</p>

<p>Here is a little bit of me. My name is Xiaotong Shen and I studied Media and Communication and Swedish in Sweden. I grew up in Beijing, studied my bachelor in HangZhou and master in Sweden. The bond between me and Beijing has dwindled away.</p>

<p>By creating this blog, I will record my study journey in data science and cultural experiences.</p>

<p>It feels a bit late to record my life nowâ€¦ anyhow, itâ€™s better than doing nothing.</p>
