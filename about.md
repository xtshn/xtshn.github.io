Hej!  

Here is a little bit of me. My name is Xiaotong Shen and I studied Media and Communication and Swedish in Sweden. I grew up in Beijing, studied my bachelor in HangZhou and master in Sweden. The bond between me and Beijing has dwindled away. 

By creating this blog, I will record my study journey in data science and cultural experiences.  

It feels a bit late to record my life now... anyhow, it's better than doing nothing.
